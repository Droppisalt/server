Actors/Directors/Writers?
    If you want to show me how to do your style with the category at the top, I could do those with the pictures from TMDb.org. Same with Genres, not sure where I could get those or where you usually find the original posters for your versions. Maybe I could ask other creators for permission to edit theirs.

    I'd actually be interested in helping out in any and all posters. Not sure if you'd want me to do some and send them over to you for you to post (I don't really want to upload them since they're your design/Aloha's). Never really done any professional posters, I only did a couple on my profile for my own use.
